# Vultr: Archlinux Installation

- Upload Arclinux install media
- Create server instance and attach that media. See example in [lauanch.sh](lauanch.sh)
- Launch console to login to `archiso`
- Set temp root password for `archiso`, just to be safe while installing.
- Run installation script `bash <(wget -qO- https://github.com/sungsit/vultr/raw/master/archlinux/install-jp.sh)`
